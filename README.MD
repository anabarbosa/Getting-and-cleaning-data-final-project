#Getting and Cleaning Data - Final Project

This is the final project of Coursera's John Hopkin's Course "Getting and Cleaning Data". 

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 


## Data used in the analysis


The source data used in this project can be found in [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

## Summary

Here is a brief description of what the code does (run_analysis.R), which is in accordance with the project guidelines given:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

To run the script you will need to set your working location on the setwd line 1 of the R script.
